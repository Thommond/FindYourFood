# The concept 

So you can't deciede where to eat. This programs plan is to give you the ideas. 
You would put in your zip code and desired radius of search for food. You could 
also put your type of food desired, type of food not to search for, or similar places
to a restaurant of your choice. Using your input the program would search the area 
for your matching restaurants. If you can't decide from a long list then you can continue to 
filter with the plethora of filters there will be to assist you. If the brute force 
search does not help you then you could take the restaurant quiz. Then based off of your
results from the questionare / quiz also including your designated area the program would 
give you the top five choices and some honorable mentions. This of course will be in a GUI 
platform. Planning on it to be used with React.js and C#.NET
